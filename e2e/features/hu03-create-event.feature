Feature: Create an event with date and time options
  As an organizer, I want to create an event with date and time options,
  without filling a sign-up form, so that my group can tell me when they can meet.

  Background:
    Given today is "2026-06-15" in "Europe/Madrid"
    And I am signed in as "ana@example.com" with the name "Ana"

  Scenario: An event with dates only is created and gets its links
    When I create the event "Cena de verano" with the dates "2026-07-06" and "2026-07-10"
    Then I see the "¡Hecho!" step with the participation link
    And the participation link shows the options:
      | option         |
      | lun 6 jul      |
      | vie 10 jul     |
    And the event has a management link and a results link, both different from the participation link

  Scenario: Each time is one option and a date without times is a whole day
    When I create the event "Cena de verano" with the options:
      | dates      | time        |
      | 2026-07-06 | 18:15       |
      | 2026-07-06 | 20:00-22:00 |
      | 2026-07-10 |             |
    Then participants vote on exactly these 3 options, in this order:
      | option                  |
      | lun 6 jul, 18:15        |
      | lun 6 jul, 20:00–22:00  |
      | vie 10 jul, sin horario |

  Scenario: Overlapping options are kept apart
    When I create the event "Viaje" with the options:
      | dates                 |
      | 2026-07-06..2026-07-09 |
      | 2026-07-08            |
    Then participants vote on 2 options

  Scenario: The summary lists every option as it will be voted
    Given I have chosen the date "2026-07-10" and the date "2026-07-06" with the times "20:00-22:00" and "18:15"
    When I reach the summary step
    Then it lists, in this order:
      | option                  |
      | lun 6 jul, 18:15        |
      | lun 6 jul, 20:00–22:00  |
      | vie 10 jul, sin horario |

  Scenario: The event survives an API restart
    Given I have created the event "Cena de verano"
    When the API restarts
    Then the participation link still shows "Cena de verano" with its options

  Scenario: "Siguiente" stays disabled until the step is valid
    When I open the creation wizard
    Then "Siguiente" is disabled
    And I see why next to the empty title and name fields
    When I type the title "Cena de verano" and the name "Ana"
    Then "Siguiente" is enabled

  Scenario: A deadline after the first date warns but does not block
    Given I have chosen the date "2026-07-06"
    When I set the deadline to "2026-07-08"
    Then I see a warning that the deadline is after the first date
    And I can still create the event

  Scenario: The API enforces the option limits
    When the API is asked to create an event with 61 options
    Then it answers 400 and no event is created
    When the API is asked to create an event with a date on "2027-07-01"
    Then it answers 400 and no event is created
    When the API is asked to create an event with two equal options
    Then it answers 400 and no event is created
    When the API is asked to create an event with the time range "20:00-19:00"
    Then it answers 400 and no event is created

  Scenario: A server error keeps the wizard
    Given the API will fail the next request
    When I press "Crear"
    Then I see an error with "Reintentar"
    And the wizard still holds everything I entered
